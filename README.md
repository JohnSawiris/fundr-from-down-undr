# User Stories

[ ] As a user, I want to see a list of all projects, ideas, and charitable acts that are seeking funding.
[ ] As a user, I want to click a project to see more details.
[ ] As a user, I'd like to know the details of a project before I decide whether to fund it. Including things like a name, the project starters/managers, a description, the amount of money the project is hoping to raise, what they'll do with the funds raised, and whether I get any cool swag or rewards for funding a project.
[ ] As a user, I want to be able to filter projects as I browse them. Perhaps by the amount of funding they still require, or whether they're charitable acts, ideas for products, or other.
[ ] As a user, I want to click a button or fill out a form to fund a project.
[ ] As a user, I want the option to post my own project or charitable act that seeks funding.
[ ] As an administrator, I want to add, update, or delete projects as necessary. (User authentication is not required).
[ ] As a user, as the site grows I want ideas, projects, and charitable acts to be separate types of objects, each residing on their own page. Things like charitable acts might have different types of properties/details than companies seeking startup funding, too.
[ ] As a user, I want to select a category to view a page containing all projects in that category.
